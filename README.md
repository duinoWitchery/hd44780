Library Overview
=================
hd44780 is an extensible Arduino LCD library for hd44780 based LCD displays.
The library consists of a hd44780 base class combined with one or more
i/o subclasses to perform the i/o communication between the host and the
hd44780 display interface.

While the library is API compatible with the Arduino IDE bundled LiquidCrystal library, hd44780 is not a direct drop in replacement for the LiquidCrystal library.

The API functionality provided by the hd44780 base class, when combined
with an hd44780 library i/o subclass, is compatible with most of the API
functionality of the Arduino LiquidCrystal library as well as
with most of the LCD API 1.0 Specification (some of which is nearly obsolete).

The hd44780 API also provides some addtional extensions and all the API
functions provided by hd44780 are common across all i/o subclasses.
The most most significant extensions being:
- ability to enable automatic line wrapping
- ability to modify the libraries expected command execution times.
- API functions return a status to indicate whether successful
- automatic detection and s/w work around for LCD keypad shields with bad backlight circuit
- self configuration of i2c address and pin mappings for i2c backpacks
- ability to tell if lcd initialization failed
- ability to read data or status from the LCD (requires r/w control)
- ability to tell if sending a raw command to the LCD failed

S/W requirements
================
- ### IDE version 1.0.1 or later (versions 1.6.9 and higher are recommended)

- ### IDE versions that should be avoided:
	- IDE versions 1.5 to 1.55 (unnecessary file name restrictions, breaks many libraries)
	- IDE version 1.6.6 (has function prototyping issues that can break some sketches)
	- IDE version 1.6.8 (has serial port issues that breaks on certain boards)

H/W support
===========
Library should work on all Arduino boards including boards with AVR, pic32, arm, and ESP8266 processors.

**WARNING**<br>
Use caution when using 3v only processors like arm and ESP8266 processors when interfacing with 5v modules
as not doing proper level shifting or incorrectly hooking things up can damage the processor.

The library currenly comes with the following i/o subclasses:

* `hd44780_HC1627_I2C` control LCD with native i2c interface (Tsingtek Display HC1627)

* `hd44780_I2Cexp` control LCD using i2c i/o exapander backpack (PCF8574 or MCP23008)

* `hd44780_I2Clcd` control LCD with native i2c interface (PCF2116, PCF2119x, etc...)

* `hd44780_NTCU165ECPB` control Noritake CU165ECBP-T2J LCD display over SPI

* `hd44780_NTCU20025ECPB_pinIO` control Noritake CU20025ECPB using direct Arduino pin connections

* `hd44780_NTCUUserial` control Noritake CU-U Series VFD display in serial mode

* `hd44780_pinIO` control LCD using direct Arduino Pin connections

Installation
============
For generic information about Arduino libraries and how to install them consult the Arduino Libraries page:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

For ease of proper installation, the preferred method of installing the library is to use the library manager.
The use of importing a .zip file is highly discouraged unless using IDE versions prior to version 1.6.2

### Installation using Library manager (IDE 1.6.2 and later)
In the IDE, Simply click on:<br>
**[Sketch]->Include Library->Manage Libraries...**<br>
or<br>
**[Tools]->Manage Libraries...**<br>
Then search for "Extensible hd44780" to locate the library and install it.<br>
There is no need to uninstall or modify any other LCD libary that may have already been installed.

#### Installation using zip file w/o library manager (IDE 1.6.1 and earlier)
Installation requires downloading a zip image and
then, depending on the version of the IDE you can either install it from the IDE or install it manually by unziping the file into your sketchbook libraries.

**NOTE**: due to the way github creates its zip files, there is a manual step that must be done to rename the library directory created in your sketchbook libraries area.

First, dowload a library zip image from the github repository releases area:<br>
https://github.com/duinoWitchery/hd44780/releases <br>
Download the image by clicking the zip icon for the desired release.

#### Installation of zip file library on IDE 1.0.6 to 1.6.1
The library can be installed from the zip image using the IDE.
Install it by clicking on:
[Sketch]->Include Library->Add .ZIP library...
then, simply select the hd44780.zip image you downloaded.

The hd44780 sketchbook library must now be renamed. (see below)

#### Installation of zip file library on IDE 1.0 to 1.0.5
On these versions of the IDE, the install must be done manually.
To install the library simply extract it into your sketchbook/libraries directory.
If you don't know where you sketchbook/libraries directory is simply click on:
[File]->Preferences
or from the keyboard type: &lt;ctrl&gt;comma (hold ctrl and press comma)
The location of your sketchbook directory will be in the text box.
The zip image must be installed in a directory called "libraries" under that directory.<br>

After the zip file has been extracted and the hd44780 sketchbook library has been created,
the library must now be renamed. (see below)

### Renaming hd44780 libary directory name after manual installation w/o library manager
When not using the library manager, the hd44780 library directory created in your sketchbook libary area will not be the correct name.
This is due to the way github creates its zip files and the way the IDE library manager works.
The downloaded zip file and internal directory will have a name like hd44780-X.Y.Z which causes the sketchbook library name to also be hd44780-X.Y.Z
While the IDE will usually allow this to work, the proper name should be simply "hd44780" and not using its real name can cause issues in the future.<br>
To rename the library directory, simply go to the sketchbook library location and rename it.
If you don't know where you sketchbook/libraries directory is simply click on:
[File]->Preferences
or from the keyboard type: &lt;ctrl&gt;comma (hold ctrl and press comma)
The location of your sketchbook directory will be in the text box.<br>
Use your favorite tool to rename it.

Examples
========
Examples for the included hd44780 i/o classes are provided to demonstrate how to use LCDs with various h/w interfaces.<br>
Each i/o class included in the hd44780 library package has its own examples.<br>
You can access i/o class examples from the IDE from [File]->Examples->hd44780->ioClass and then choose the desired i/o class.<br>
hd44780 also includes some examples that use other 3rd party LCD libraries rather than hd44780 which can be found under otherLibraries.<br>
**The sketches in the hd44780examples area are special purpose sketches that are used as include files for the i/o class examples.
They should not be looked at as examples for how to use the library.**
While the hd44780examples sketches can be modified to work standalone with any LiquidCrystal API compatible library, their primary purpose, as shipped in the hd44780 library package, is to act as an include file for the i/o class wrapper sketches and are not intended to be used directly.  
**See the ioClass specific subdirectories for the examples for each ioClass.**

See **hd44780examples** sketch along with the readme files under the examples directory and the wiki for
additional information about the examples.<br>
If browsing on the hd44780 github repository, you can click on the examples
directory and its subdirectories to see each readme file.

Additional Information & Documentation
======================================
You can find additional information by using the included **Documentation** sketch.<br>
Once the hd44780 library package is installed. It can be found in the IDE from [File]->Examples->Documentation<br>
It provides hd44780 library information as well as links to further information including
* links to the hd44780 repository, hd44780 wiki.
* hd44780 custom font tools
