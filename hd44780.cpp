// hd44780 is an extensible LCD library for hd44780 based LCD displays.
// The library consists of a hd44780 base class combined with one or more
// i/o subclasses to perform the i/o communication between the host and the
// hd44780 display interface.
//
// The API functionality provided by the hd44780 base class, when combined
// with an hd44780 library i/o subclass, is compatible with the API
// functionality of the Arduino LiquidCrystal library as well as compatibilty
// with most of the LCD API 1.0 Specification (nearly obsolete).
//
// The hd44780 API also provides some addtional extensions and all the API
// functions provided by hd44780 are common across all i/o subclasses.

	 * ========================================================================
	 * The init sequence below is shown in the hitachi HD44780 datasheet
	 * figures 23 & 24, pages 45 & 46
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 * IMO, most explanations and comments about this sequence are wrong as the
	 * code authors don't really understand what it is actually doing.
	 * Adding to the confusion is that the hitachi HD44780 datasheet does
	 * a very poor job explaining this sequence. 
	 * Also, adding to the confusion is the note about FunctionSet on page 27:
	 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *	Note: Perform the function at the head of the program before executing
	 *	any instructions (except for the read busy flag and address instruction)
	 *	From this point, the function set instruction cannot be executed unless
	 *	the interface data length is changed.
	 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 * It isn't clear what information this note is trying to convey.
	 *
	 * It appears to be implying that FunctionSet must be done first and that it
	 * cannot be executed later unless the data length is changed.
	 * If that is what it saying...
	 * This is in direct conflict with the comand sequence in the
	 * Initialize by Instruction in figures 23 & 24, particulary in
	 * figure 23 as the 4th command sent will be a FunctionSet command
	 * setting data length to 8 bits as well as the prefered the N and F bits
	 * when the data length is guaranteed to already be 8 bits. 
	 *
	 * But since sending a FunctionSet command with DL=1 along with setting N
	 * and F bits works when the display is already in 8 bit mode, my conclusion
	 * is that the note on page 27 is obviously incorrect and can be ignored.
	 *
	 * --
	 *
	 * When using 4 bit length mode, the LCD expects the nibbles on d4-d7 and
	 * expects the upper nibble of the 8 bits first.
	 * Therefore, when using 4 bit mode, it is critical that the host and
	 * the LCD are in sync on the nibbles.
	 *
	 * The command sequences in figures 23 and 24 are not simple retries and
	 * there is nothing magical about the timing.
	 * They are specifically chosen to ensure that after completion,
	 * the LCD is in the desired interface mode (8 bit or 4 bit).
	 * The two sequences start off with an identical 3 command sequence of
	 * FunctionSet commands which are used to reliably put the LCD into
	 * 8 bit length mode regardless of what mode or state the LCD happends
	 * to be in and regardless of whether the host is controlling all 8 data
	 * pin signals or just d4-d7.
	 * The only difference between the two sequences is that the 4 bit
	 * initializaion (figure 24) puts the LCD interface into 4 bit mode
	 * after the LCD is assured to be in 8 bit mode.
	 *
	 * 
	 * Below is a detailed explanation of the hd44780 initalization sequence
	 *
	 * --- bperrybap
	 *
	 * The overall methodology is to carefully use a command sequence that can
	 * first reliably put the LCD back into 8 bit mode and then if using 4 bit
	 * mode, a command can be issued to put the LCD into 4 bit mode.
	 * This sequence is not reseting the display but rather re-initalizing the
	 * host interface mode (8 bit or 4 bit)
	 * It also ensures that a host that can only control data lines D4-D7 is
	 * able to reliably get into nibble sync with the LCD and put the LCD into
	 * 4 bit mode regardless of the what state the LCD is currently in.
	 *
	 * This special initailization command sequence is required beause there is
	 * no way to actully reset the LCD to its power up default state and
	 * there is no way of knowing if the LCD is currently in 4bit or 8bit mode.
	 * Even if the h/w inteface is 8 bits, the LCD could potentially be in
	 * 4 bit mode.
	 * Also, if the LCD is in 4 bit mode, the LCD could be in the middle of
	 * receiving nibbles. i.e. the system was reset after only a single
	 * nibble was sent to the LCD.
	 * When the LCD is in 4 bit mode and out of nibble sync with the host:
	 * 	the LCD has received the upper/1st nibble of a command/data byte and
	 *	is waiting for the lower/2nd nibble.
	 *	After the 2nd nibble is recieved, the LCD will go off and execute an
	 *	unknown command. This is why the firt delay is so long. The host has to
	 *  accomodate the longest possible command execution time.
	 *	The next two FunctionSet commands will be interpreted
	 *	as a single FunctionSet command by the LCD to put the display back into 
	 *	8 bit mode.
	 *
	 * It appears that all delays specified in figures 23 & 24 are 2.7x the
	 * execution times in table 6. It appears that these values were chosen to
	 * accomodate LCDs that are running chips clocked slower than the 270kHz
	 * reference used in table 6
	 * A 2.7x factor would allow the Initialize by Instruction sequence to work
	 * with chips clocked down to 100Khz.
	 *
	 * In each of the 3 steps, EN is strobed once as the host will be
	 * treating the LCD h/w interface as if it is 8 bits wide regardless of
	 * whether the actual h/w interface to the LCD may only be 4 bits.
	 * d4-d7 signals on the hd44780 interface are set for 
	 * a function set "goto 8bit mode" command.
	 * Also, d0-d3 signals on the physical hd44780 interface are either set to
	 * low, or not driven in the case of 4 bit only h/w host interfaces.
	 *
	 * Here is the command sequence shown seperately for each of 3 states the
	 * LCD can be in. 
	 * This will demonstrate why there must be a command sequence
	 * of three "goto 8 bit mode" followed by one "goto to 4 bit mode" if
	 * using 4 bit mode.
	 *
	 * ========================================================================
	 * LCD in 8 BIT mode:
	 * =================
	 * 1) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		8bit host: LCD interprets command 0x30
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be low and read as zeros.
	 *		4bit host: LCD interprets command 0x3X
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be unpredictable
	 *			FUNCTION_SET & 8BIT are set, so it gets interpreted as a
	 *			"goto 8bit mode" and so this is essentially a NOP as the
 	 *			display is already 8 bit mode
	 *
	 * 2) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		8bit host: LCD interprets command 0x30
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be low and read as zeros.
	 *		4bit host: LCD interprets command 0x3X
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be unpredictable
	 *			FUNCTION_SET & 8BIT are set, so it gets interpreted as a
	 *			"goto 8bit mode" and so this is essentially a NOP as the
 	 *			display is already 8 bit mode
	 *
	 * 3) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		8bit host: LCD interprets command 0x30
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be low and read as zeros.
	 *		4bit host: LCD interprets command 0x3X
	 *			since lower 4 bits will be unpredictable
	 *			FUNCTION_SET & 8BIT are set, so it gets interpreted as a
	 *			"goto 8bit mode" and so this is essentially a NOP as the
 	 *			display is already 8 bit mode
	 *
	 * LCD in 4 bit mode and expecting upper/1st nibble:
	 * =================================================
	 * 1) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		LCD pulls in nibble as upper 4 bits of 8 bit command
	 *
	 * 2) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		LCD pulls in nibble as lower 4 bits to complete 8 bits of command
	 *		LCD interprets command 0x33.
	 *			the LCD sees a Goto 8bit mode command and changes to 8 bit mode.
	 *
	 * 3) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		LCD interprets command 0x30 on 8bit hosts since
	 *			 lower 4 bits will be low and read as zeros.
	 *		LCD interprets command 0x3X on 4 bit hosts since
	 *			 lower 4 bits will be unpredictable
	 *		since FUNCTION_SET & 8BIT are set, it gets interpreted as
	 *			 a "goto 8bit mode" and so
	 * 		this is essentially a NOP as the display is already 8 bit mode
	 *
	 * LCD in 4 bit mode and expecting lower/2nd nibble:
	 * (out of nibble sync with host)
	 * ========================================================================
	 * 1) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		LCD pulls in nibble as lower 4 bits to complete 8 bits of command
	 *		LCD interprets command with upper nibble (unknown) and lower
	 *		nibble 0x3
	 *		There is no telling what this command does as the upper nibble is
	 *		unknown. And THAT is why the first delay in the sequence must be so
	 *		long. It isn't that the the first "function set" takes that long it
	 *		is because there is no telling what command might now be executing
	 *		and BUSY cannot be used yet.
	 *		Therefore, the host must blind wait the worst case amount of time.
	 *		A 4.1ms delay appears to be 2.7x the worst case instruction
	 *		execution time (clear & home are 1.52ms) at a 270kHz LCD clock rate.
	 *		(4.1ms would accomodate a chip clocked at 100kHz instead of 270 kHz)
	 *
	 * 2) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		If LCD happened to go into 8BIT mode in step 1
	 *			LCD interprets this command as 0x30
	 *				since d0-d3 lower 4 bits will be read as zeros in 8 bit mode
	 *				This is essentially a NOP as the display is already in
	 *				8 bit mode
	 *
	 *		If LCD still in 4 bit mode,
	 *			then this is upper nibble of next command.
	 *
	 * 3) Set the upper 4 bits (d4-d7) of Functionset: FUNCTION_SET|8BIT = 0x3
	 *		If LCD happened to go into 8BIT mode in step 1
	 *			LCD interprets this command as 0x30
	 *				since d0-d3 lower 4 bits will be read as zeros in 8 bit mode
	 *				This is essentially a NOP as the display is already in
	 *				8 bit mode
	 *
	 *		If LCD still in 4 bit mode
	 *			LCD pulls in nibble as lower 4 bits to complete 8 bits of cmd
	 *			LCD interprets command 0x33.
	 *			the LCD sees a Goto 8bit mode command and changes to 8 bit mode.
	 *
	 *
	 * =======================================================================
	 * Once the display in 8 bit mode, if the interface is to be in 4 bit mode:
	 * =======================================================================
 	 * - Set the upper 4 bits of Functionset: with 8BIT clear
	 *	this puts the LCD in 4 bit and it now expects upper nibble
	 */

    
	/*
	 * Note:
	 * The initialization sequence below uses special hd44780 internal API
	 * for 4 bit commands.
	 * Internal 4 bit commands are commands that are sent to the LCD using
	 * only a single strobe of EN even if the host h/w interface is 4 bit only.
	 * In other words it is indicating that only the upper 4 bits need to be
	 * sent to the display - so effectively the host must ensure that the
	 * upper four bits are placed on D4-d7 and that EN is stobed only once
	 * including if the host h/w interface is only 4 bits wide.
	 *
	 * 8bit only i/o interface libraries can ignore this as the bits for these
	 * special commands are in the proper d4-d7 bit locations so the full
	 * 8 bit byte can be presented to the LCD.
	 * i.e.
	 *  - 8 bit interfaces can treat 4bit commands the same as regular commands
	 *  - 4 bit only interfaces will send just the upper 4 bits (d4-d7)
	 *
	 * Additional Note:
	 *	The Initiatlization by Instruction figures 23 & 24 of the hitachi spec
	 *	seems to use delays that are 2.7x the specified instruction times based
	 *	on a 270khz clock from table 6
	 *  i.e. 4.1ms is 2.7x 1.52ms of clear/home commands
	 *	and 100us is 2.7x 37us for all the other instructions (cmd & data)
	 *  The delay values appear to be accomodating LCDs clocked down to 100kHz
	 *	rather than at the 270Khz reference.
	 *	This library will wait a little bit longer given the delay functions
	 *	used. However, since iowrite() honors execution times, 
	 *  the delays here are in addition to the configured execution times
	 *	and technically should not be needed.
	 *  So if the application called setExecTimes() with excution
	 *  values prior to begin() those will be in addition to these
	 *  delays so everthing should work no matter how slow the LCD is.
	 *
	 * Note that delay() is used here vs delayMicroSeconds() as delay()
	 * on later versions of Arduino core code calls some scheduling functions
	 * like yield() to potentially allow other code to execute during this time period.
	 *
	 * delay() can be used because this code is never called from a constructor
